# ngWheelNavigator
Directive to internally wrap in angular the  [wheelnav from Softwaretailoring](https://github.com/softwaretailoring/wheelnav/)
This directive is intended for the Pont-MO Environment only.
To match with other environments some adjustment can be needed.

## Dependencies
```
angular.js
raphael.js 
wheelnav.js
```
or with Bower
```
bower -install -- save wheelnav
```

##Setup
Import the directive, there is no need to inject in controller.

##Settings
> _CURRENTCONTEXTURL

this global variable is inherited from the environment. It is used to find the correct link to the template.

> scope.baseUrl = 

This variable gives the base url for the links of the navigator.
> scope.params =

This variable is concatenated to the base url and gives the parameters to be passed in the link of the navigator.

> scope.pieItems = [{"id": INT, "link":STRING},{...}]

This object contains the array of elements to be show on the navigator and the final part of the link.
The total number of the elements should be 7. For different numbers see the customization section.

###Customization
It's possible to change the number of items and the behaviour of the navigator using the code generated from this site.
http://pmg.softwaretailoring.net/

It is possible to change the colors and position of the navigator changing the sass file related _wheelNavigator.scss.

The icons are set inside the template and are the ones from [font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).
We used the escaped unicode value inside the template navigator object.
